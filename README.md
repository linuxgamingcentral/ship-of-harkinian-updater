Download, update, and play SoH. It was primarily designed to be used with the Steam Deck but it should literally work across any Linux distro, so long as your distro has `p7zip-full` installed (for installing OoT Reloaded). You can also view the SoH changelog, install a couple of Steam Deck-specific mods, and install high-resolution textures.

If you're on Steam Deck, download the [desktop file]() (right-click, save link as...) and run it. Other distros can run the script with:
`curl -L `

The script will create a `soh` folder in the same directory that the script was run. Put your legally-dumped ROM inside of this folder in order to play SoH (see my [ROM dumping guide for Steam Deck](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ship-of-harkinian-steam-deck-guide/) if you need to get your ROM dumped).
